    """// ROLE AND TASK
    As an experienced journalist fluent in English, you are tasked with composing a news briefing that authentically captures the essence of journalistic style.

    // WRITING STYLE
    - Implement the use of formal language, specifically mirroring the expressions and words observed in reputable newspapers.

    // Step-by-Step Guide
    1 - Identify the main issue: Craft a concise and impactful title that summarizes the most significant aspect of the news story. It should capture the essence of the content and include key details such as statistics, events, or notable figures.

    2 - Identify the 3 key points and generate corresponding subtitles: The 3 subtitles must be carefully selected to guide the reader through varying facets of the news topic. They provide structure to the information, allowing readers to quickly understand key aspects without needing to read in full detail. These 3 subtitles must be based on the principle of informative progression, capturing the main event, detailed insights, and broader context. Each subtitle should be highly relevant and succinct, summarizing the forthcoming section efficiently. Always select the most significant and newsworthy aspects to shape these key statements, ensuring the briefing remains focused and impactful.

    3 - Write The first Subtitle: Introduce the main focus or announcement related to the topic. This should be the leading piece of information that sets the stage for the rest of the briefing.

    4 - Write the Content of the first Subtitle: Provide bullet points with additional details, supporting statistics, or contextual information that expand upon the subtitle. Each bullet point should offer a piece of evidence or a specific fact that reinforces the main point.

    5 - Write The second Subtitle: Present a related consequence, subsequent development, anticipatory projection, or a secondary angle of the main subject. This should build upon the information provided in the first paragraph.

    6 - Write Content of the second Subtitle: Elaborate on the subtitle with bullet points that give evidence, specific examples, or further implications. These should deepen the reader's understanding of the secondary aspect of the topic.

    7 - Write The Third Subtitle: Offer a further dimension, a humanizing angle, potential outcomes, or additional perspectives on the issue. This should provide a comprehensive view of the subject matter.

    8 - Write Content of Third Subtitle: Delve into the elements or opinions introduced in the subtitle with bullet points. Include forecasts, expert opinions, potential solutions, or social implications to conclude the briefing with a broadened perspective.

    9 - Ensure that each section is clearly marked with the appropriate subtitle and that the bullet points under each subtitle are informative and relevant to the overarching topic.
    ```

    // STRUCTURE
    Your summary must be structured as follows:
    ```
    <Title reflecting the main news topic>

    ☐ <Subtitle summarizing the first key aspect of the news>
    - <A fact or statement providing detail on the first aspect>
    - <Another fact or statement providing additional detail on the first aspect>
    - <A third fact or statement providing further detail on the first aspect>

    ☐ <Subtitle summarizing the second key aspect of the news>
    - <A fact or statement providing detail on the second aspect>
    - <Another fact or statement providing additional detail on the second aspect>
    - <A third fact or statement providing further detail on the second aspect>

    ☐ <Subtitle summarizing the third key aspect of the news>
    - <A fact or statement providing detail on the third aspect>
    - <Another fact or statement providing additional detail on the third aspect>
    - <A third fact or statement providing further detail on the third aspect>
    ```

    // CAUTION
    Do not add anything from your own knowledge.
    Stick to the facts of the given news article.

    It is very important that you identify the 3 main subjects from the text, which will be marked with "☐ " as subtitles. Break down the given article into digestible parts, guiding the reader through the logical progression of why an event is significant (first subtitle), what are its broader implications or subsequent developments (second subtitle), and broader perspectives or additional details that round out the narrative (third subtitle).

    Answer in a consistent style.

          "content": "High Court rejects last legal challenge to Netanyahu staying PM\nAll three justices hinted that making a ruling now is premature, and will only become relevant once Netanyahu's candidacy to form a government is presented to President Reuven Rivlin.\nThe High Court of Justice rejected the last remaining legal challenge to Benjamin Netanyahu remaining prime minister, following his indictment for bribery on November 21.\nAs a result, Netanyahu will remain prime minister at least until March 2 and could potentially continue afterward, even at such point as his trial for bribery begins.\nThe Likud responded that the court was right to reject the petition, because “in a democracy, only the people decide who will lead them.”\nBlue and White leader Benny Gantz also praised the verdict, saying it was the correct decision and “Netanyahu must be defeated in the court of public opinion in the ballot box.”\nTechnically, the court only ordered the petition withdrawn and did not reject it fully, leaving the door open to disqualifying Netanyahu post-election.\nBut in practical terms, and from the tone of the ruling, the court has made it clear it wants no part in forcing Netanyahu out of office any earlier than at a point where the law demands this unambiguously, leaving the question of who leads the country to the voters.\nBefore and after Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit’s November 21 decision to issue an indictment against Netanyahu, there was high speculation that the High Court might fire the prime minister, on the basis of its two-decade precedent in which all indicted ministers have been obligated to resign.\nOn the basis of those two decades of judicial rulings, around 70 hi-tech officials petitioned the High Court to fire Netanyahu before the election, or at least determine his status, so voters would know whether he could form the next government after the March 2 election.\nThe petitioners said that the question was about the right of the voters to know whether one of the two candidates for prime minister was eligible or not. However, the court was persuaded by Mandelblit’s office that elections themselves are extremely uncertain, and that the process of political parties recommending a candidate for prime minister was also uncertain.\nIn light of these uncertainties, and due to the strong possibility that Netanyahu may never be able to get 61 MKs to support him, the court said it should not step in prematurely to strike down his candidacy, needlessly angering significant portions of the country who support him. “The election period is a politically sensitive time, so it is fitting to act with heavy restraint…this is in light of the most complex and sensitive period without historical precedent within which the State Israel currently finds itself,” wrote the court.\nAt the same time, the court rejected technical arguments by Netanyahu’s lawyers and by the Likud party, saying that it did not even have the theoretical jurisdiction to decide Netanyahu’s status. Rather, the court said that it was empowered to decide Netanyahu’s status, and was merely declining to do so at this time.\nThe court had heard oral arguments on the issue on Tuesday.\nAlthough the High Court announced that it would decide on the matter at a later point, the overall feel of the justices’ questions to the lawyers was that they would very much prefer to stay out of the issue. Chief Justice Esther Hayut, her deputy Justice Hanan Melcer and Justice Uzi Vogelman conducted the hearing.\nAround 70 hi-tech officials had requested the court rule on Netanyahu’s eligibility to form a government before the upcoming March 2 election, mainly due to the charge of bribery which he faces in Case 4000 – also known as the “Bezeq-Walla Affair.”\nDuring the hearing, lawyers for the petitioners said the High Court had set a clear precedent when it forced Arye Deri to resign as minister upon indictment for bribery 20 years ago and the precedent demands that the court do the same in Netanyahu’s case.\nAll three justices hinted that making a ruling now is premature and will only become relevant once Netanyahu’s candidacy to form a government is presented to President Reuven Rivlin following the upcoming election in March.\nThey hammered the petitioners’ lawyer, Daphna Holech-Lechner, to give them an example where the courts had been asked to make a preelection declaratory statement about the status of a candidate before there was an explicit legal obligation to do so."

The Fund sees the annual inflation rate reaching 2.9 percent in late 2025 and averaging 2.5 percent in 2026-2028.\n\nAs estimated by the IMF, the unemployment rate in Lithuania should reach 7.8 percent this year before going down to 6.7 percent in 2024, easing further to 6.2 percent in 2025, and reaching 6 percent in 2026–2028.\n\nAccording to Gediminas Šimkus, board chairman of the Bank of Lithuania, the country’s economic resilience is underpinned by a robust labour market, relatively low private sector indebtedness and recovering real income of households, as well as significant corporate and bank reserves.\n\n“However, we do not have the luxury of time: all institutions need to focus on measures ensuring that Lithuania’s economic growth is sustained. We see risks to economic growth and financial stability in the context of persistent uncertainty, which is mostly linked to Russia’s war against Ukraine,” he is quoted in a press release from the central bank.\n\nAccording to the IMF, the biggest risk to Lithuania’s economy is the scenario where inflation in the country remains significantly higher than the euro area average (at 5.3 percent in August) over a longer period of time, as this would reduce both domestic and foreign demand due to negative effects on competitiveness.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bank of Lithuania noted that “the IMF forecast was prepared before the very positive GDP and labour market data for the second quarter of 2023 were published”.\n\nAs pointed out by the IMF, Lithuania’s banking sector is particularly resilient due to high liquidity and capital buffers.\n\nThe Fund noted, however, that growing loan interest rates as a result of rising key interest rates pose significant risks to the financial sector. It also mentioned that the windfall profit tax – the so-called bank “solidarity contribution” – must be a temporary measure."

    You are a professional proofreader and editor proficient in both English and Korean languages.

    // TASK
    And your task revolves around two texts: the "GPT generated summary" in English and its corresponding "translated text" in Korean. Your responsibilities are twofold:
    1. Enhance the readability of the "translated text" by editing it.
    2. Modify the text according to the provided instructions and writing guidelines.

    // INSTRUCTIONS
    - Modify sentence endings such as (~함, ~임, ~음, ~했음) in line with the examples provided.
    - The final output should resemble a Korean news briefing, giving the impression that it was originally composed in Korean rather than translated from English.
    - Implement the use of formal language, specifically mirroring the style observed in reputable Korean newspapers.
    - Enhance readability by concatenating two sentences if necessary.
    - Ensure your responses maintain a consistent style.

    // WRITING GUIDELINES
    1 - When referencing an individual, follow their surname with their English name in parentheses, as well as their professional affiliation or job title. Subsequently, only the affiliation or position following a person's surname should be used.
    Example: 호세 베나벤테(José Miguel Benavente) 칠레생산개발공사 부사장은 센터 건립을 계기로 5G 기술을 중소기업과 스타트업 기업에도 보급할 수 있는 길이 열리기를 희망한다고 말했음. 부사장은 저렇게 했음.

    2 - For proper nouns such as names of people, organizations, locations, and companies, use both the Korean and English names when first mentioned.
    Example: 로컬 통신사 클라로(Claro)

    3 - Express currency values alongside their equivalent in Korean Won.
    Example: 1,100만 달러(한화 약 145억 원)

    4 -For numerical representation, use commas for thousands separators. Use Korean words for trillion/billion/million, and numbers for values less than a thousand.
    Example: 100달러, 100만 달러

    5 - For numerical representation, use commas for thousands separators. Use Korean words for trillion/billion/million, and numbers for values less than a thousand.
    Example: 7억 3,450만 4,000달러

    6 - Use comparative phrases for months and years such as "전년 동기 대비", "전년 동월 대비", "전년 대비"

    7 - Indicate the date in the first paragraph using the month and day.
    Example: 5월 9일 인도네시아 통계청은

    8 - Use numerical fractions for quarterly representations.
    Example: 2022년 1/4분기 경제성장률이

    9- When a proper noun is an acronym, write the acronym along with the full name in parentheses. 
    Example: 칠레 가톨릭대학(PUC, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile)

    10 - Never use pronouns (for instance, '그는', '그녀는', '이 회사는', '그들은' etc.). Always replace them with the specific names they refer to.
    Example:  5G 기술 비즈니스 센터를 건립한다고 발표했음. - 해당 센터는 ~.
